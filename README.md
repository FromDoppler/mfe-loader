# MFE Loader

_MFE Loader_ is a tool to support an indirection layer between HTML files and his JavaScript and CSS dependencies, allowing us to deploy new versions of our _micro-frontends_ without modifying the HTML files where they are used.

In the HTML files, this loader is included and then used to load the entry points referenced in some _asset-manifest_ files, for example:

```html
<!-- https://app.fromdoppler.com/editors/ -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- . . . -->
    <script src="https://cdn.fromdoppler.com/mfe-loader/loader-v1.1.0.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      assetServices.load({
        manifestURL:
          "https://cdn.fromdoppler.com/doppler-style-guide/asset-manifest-v1.json",
      });
      assetServices.load({
        manifestURL:
          "https://cdn.fromdoppler.com/editors-webapp/asset-manifest-v1.json",
      });
    </script>
    <!-- . . . -->
  </head>
</html>
```

`assetServices.load` will download the _asset-manifest_ JSON files and then update the DOM to load the _javascript_ and _css_ files referenced in those _manifests_.

## How to use it

1. Add the reference to the last version of the loader:

   ```html
   <script src="https://cdn.fromdoppler.com/mfe-loader/loader-{version}.js"></script>
   ```

2. Load the dependencies

   ```html
   <script type="text/javascript">
     // Optional configuration here
     assetServices.load({
       manifestURL: "{asset-manifest-URL}",
     });
   </script>
   ```

### Configure the dependencies

Some dependencies require configuration. In general, we are doing it using global variables defined by convention. For example:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  window["editors-webapp-configuration"] = {
    basename: "editors-demo",
    unlayerProjectId: 32092,
    htmlEditorApiBaseUrl: "https://apis.fromdoppler.com/html-editor",
    loginPageUrl: "https://app.fromdoppler.com/login"
  };

  assetServices.load({
    // . . .
</script>
```

### `assetServices.load()`

```typescript
interface IAssetServices {
  load({
    manifestURL,
    sources,
  }: {
    manifestURL: string;
    sources?: string[];
  }): Promise<void>;
  // . . .
}
```

**Parameters:**

- `manifestURL`: It is the URL of the _asset-manifest_.

- `sources`: A optional list of JavaScript or CSS resources that will be loaded after the files referenced in the _asset-manifest_.

**Result:**

It returns a promise. The promise is fulfilled when the _asset-manifest_ is loaded and the DOM updated. It does not warrant that the files referenced in the _asset-manifest_ have been loaded yet.

## How to contribute

Take into account that each time that we need to use a new version of the loader, we need to modify the places where it is being used. So, try to:

- Keep it as backward-compatible as possible

- Keep it stable, avoid risky changes and test it well

- Keep options open for a graceful evolution of the API

See [doppler-jenkins-ci.groovy](./doppler-jenkins-ci.groovy) for details about CI/CD process. For the moment, it is similar to our other frontend projects, see a more detailed explanation in [Unlayer Editor repository](https://github.com/FromDoppler/unlayer-editor#ci--cd).

But, _the loader does not use the loader to be loaded ðŸ˜›_, for that reason the _asset-manifest_ based versioning does not apply here.

The [task DE-669](https://makingsense.atlassian.net/browse/DE-669) is to automate the related improvement in the continuous deployment process. But, in the meantime, this is the manual process to publish a new version:

1. Do and merge in the `main` branch the desired changes.

2. Generate a version creating the git tag, for example: `v1.2.3`.

3. The previous step fires the CD process and generates the _asset-manifest_ file, for example: `https://cdn.fromdoppler.com/mfe-loader/asset-manifest-v1.2.3.json`.

4. Read the _asset-manifest_ file, and identify the generated bundle file, for example: `https://cdn.fromdoppler.com/mfe-loader/static/js/main.a58832ef.js`

5. Using our SFTP, copy that file to the friendly version file, for example: `https://cdn.fromdoppler.com/mfe-loader/static/js/main.a58832ef.js` to `https://cdn.fromdoppler.com/mfe-loader/loader-v1.2.3.js`
